# TreeSplaner

TreeSplaner is a Python library designed to interpret tree-based machine learning models, such as decision trees from `scikit-learn`, by converting their decision rules into natural language. This can be useful for model interpretability, helping users understand the structure and logic behind predictions in a clear and accessible way.

## Features

- Converts decision tree rules to natural language descriptions.
- Provides text-based explanations for predictions on specific samples.
- Outputs impurity information for each decision path, indicating classification certainty.
